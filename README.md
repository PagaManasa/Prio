# Project Overview

## Theme of the Project
The primary objective is to develop educational games that are not only entertaining but also impart knowledge and moral values. The games will help raise awareness among children about global issues like poverty, quality education, inequality, gender equality, marine life preservation, and energy consumption, in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Introduction
This project focuses on creating mobile games that entertain and educate simultaneously. The aim is to address real-world problems by making children more aware of them through gameplay. The games will instill moral values, ethics, manners, and life skills that extend beyond entertainment, helping kids learn how to deal with challenges in real life.

## Problem Statement
The world is grappling with critical issues such as poverty, inequality, poor access to quality education, gender inequality, and environmental challenges. While children spend a significant amount of time playing mobile games for fun, these games could serve a dual purposeâ€”entertaining them while educating them about global issues.

## Empathy Map

- **No Poverty**: Over 10% of the world's population still lives in extreme poverty. Initiatives like "Rural Development" have been introduced, yet poverty remains a significant global challenge.
  
- **Quality Education**: Government initiatives like the "Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan" aim to provide universal quality education. Games can highlight the importance of education and make learning more engaging.

- **Good Health and Well-Being**: The "National Health Mission" prioritizes national well-being. Games can be used to promote awareness of health-related issues and the importance of maintaining well-being.

## Existing Solutions
Current mobile games serve as great sources of entertainment and help fight boredom. However, they often do not focus on educational aspects or promote learning. This project seeks to bridge that gap by creating games that offer both fun and knowledge.

## Solution Proposal
- **Play, Win, Help**: Players can earn credit points by completing tasks like cleaning streets or engaging in healthy activities within the game. These points can then be used to donate to charitable causes or purchase essential items.
  
- **Revenue Model**: The app will generate revenue by collaborating with eco-friendly companies, and users will be encouraged to buy or use recyclable materials.

## Features
- **Healthy Living**: The app encourages healthy habits by offering fresh fruits, vegetables, and medicines at low costs in exchange for credit points earned in the game.
  
- **Sustainability**: Players are educated about sustainability through in-game actions that promote recycling and environmentally conscious behaviors.
  
- **Reward System**: Players can redeem their earned credits for prizes and essentials, including groceries and school supplies, promoting the importance of healthy and sustainable living.

## Conclusion
The project envisions a world where children learn to become responsible citizens while having fun. By integrating SDG goals into the gaming experience, it encourages a better understanding of global challenges and inspires future generations to contribute towards making the world a better place to live.
